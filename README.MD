# 🧠 AI-Based Criminal Face Generator

This project is a simple AI-based web app that generates a possible face of a criminal suspect based on descriptive input (like age, gender, face shape, and hair type). It simulates how AI could assist in identifying suspects from verbal descriptions using pre-trained models.
